# Magic 8 Ball

## Intro

This project was developed from scratch during a 2-weeks internship at [BIX Digital](https://www.bix-digital.com/). From a basic HTML + CSS knowledge base, the goal was to learn most of the relevant aspects of web development in a playful way, also learning a typical agile software workflow within a team — and to have the possibility to evolve the app further after the internship with public contributions here on Github.

## Team

- Mentors: [Ali](https://github.com/alialfa), [Bratislav](https://github.com/bljubisic), [Jan](https://github.com/netzartist)

## How to easily host your project on Github

Github Pages is an easy and free way to host a simple project online

- For more in-depth instructions you can visit [Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

- Below is a quick guideline to get your page running quickly:

Configure GitHub Pages:

    - Go to your GitHub repository's Settings tab.
    - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
    - Under "Source," choose the branch that contains your project files. 
    - If your project is in the main branch, select "main" or "master" depending on your repository's default branch name.
    - Click "Save" to apply the changes.

Access your hosted project:

    After saving, GitHub will provide you with a link to access your hosted project. 
    It will be in the format: https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>.
    e.g. https://TheOnlyROB.github.io/Magic-8-Ball/

Wait for the site to build and deploy (usually takes a few seconds to a few minutes).

    - Once the build is complete, your project should be live at the provided URL.
    - Type the URL manually in the browser, if you don't receive any notifications
