# Magic 8 Ball

## Intro

This project was developed from scratch during a 2-weeks internship at [BIX Digital](https://www.bix-digital.com/). From a basic HTML + CSS knowledge base, the goal was to learn most of the relevant aspects of web development in a playful way, also learning a typical agile software workflow within a team â€” and to have the possibility to evolve the app further after the internship with public contributions here on Github.

## Running the game

The game can be started just by running [index.html](index.html) file in a web browser.

## Demo

TODO: Add GIF or screenshot at the end of the internship
